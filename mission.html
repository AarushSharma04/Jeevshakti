                <p>EMPATHY has different definitions, depending whom you ask or what page you look it up on.</p>

                <p>But most would agree to some variation of the following: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the thoughts or feelings of another.Ã‚ To feel and display empathy, it's not necessary to share the same experiences or circumstances as others. Rather, empathy is an attempt to better understand the other by getting to know their perspective.</p>

                <p>JSF too has been born out of the need for spreading compassionate empathy towards the part of society that is almost always looked past and left to its means. We are here to not just nod in agreement with the sad state of affairs that the stray animals, be it dogs/cats/cows/monkeys or other equines live in. rather they struggle at the hands of their handlers or at the mercy of any good samaritan to feed it and not run after it with a stick. We have first hand seen the suffering of these animals and the utter lack of resources and emotional caregiving from the society and at the government level.</p>

                <p>JSF has spent the last 3 years on the ground, running and attending to the needs of these animals, understanding what ailments they safer from, what is the need of the hour and where all we lack, whether in knowledge or resources. All this research has led us to our mission- FROM THE WOMB TO THE TOMB.</p>

                <p>Our aim is to be able to care for any pregnant animal and post delivery, take care of all the vaccinations and sterilisation for the litter as well as the dog. These animals need to be monitored and dewormed and vaccinated yearly. India has the highest no of stray dog population( quote there pls) and not enough anti rabies serum. Getting the strays vaccinated against rabies should be of prime importance to our society and immediate target of the govt. We work regularly on anti rabies and 6 in1 drives and neutering the strays we can find.</p>

                <p>The issues just don't stop here. They need to be taken care of in the summers with adequate water bowls placed in and around our neighbourhoods. The chilling winters come calling with he need to wrap them up in warm coats and blankets. Then is the need to treat them for ticks, maggot wounds and other nicks and cuts they get due to the negligence of humans. The list is long and hands very limited. To speed up this process and make it more impactful, we work towards educating the people all around us, from street vendors to shop owners and traders. Basic first aid training and spreading awareness for their wellbeing as well as removing misconceptions about these strays has gone a long way in keeping them safe and making life better for these homeless beings. These all form part of our team of volunteers who are also the eyes and ears of our foundation and help us to reach out to these animals in need. Besides the smaller medical issues, come the terrifying cases of disease stricken dogs with cancer bulging out of their organs, paralysed dogs dragging themselves off the busy roads and pavements just to reach a safe place, terrified dogs displaced from their territories due to human error and now trying to find a hiding place from the existing residents.</p>

                <p>Times are tough not just for animals, but humans too with the types and intensity of diseases increasing and becoming scarier with each year. This makes it all the more crucial that our strays are kept clean and disease free, thus preventing any virus to mutate and transmit from animals to humans.</p>

                <p>Our project incorporates all aspects that would be affecting he lives of these animals and how by taking care of them, we shall be working towards making a better, more hygienic and humane society.</p>
