        <p>
            Jeevshakti Foundation came into being 2016 at the behest of an old, abandoned dog, (whom I fondly named Choti) whose painful cries tugged at my heart strings and I simply HAD to rescue her. Our eyes met and seem to bow down into the soul. My own soul had found its lifetime calling….
            Awareness grew that an alarming number of dogs are abandoned daily. Multifarious reasons are responsible for this. Has anybody ever stopped to wonder what happens to them once they are on the streets.

            - What do they eat
            - Where do they sleep
            - How do they quench their thirst in the harsh summer
            - How do they keep themselves warm in bitter winters
            - What happens when they are sick, injured and bleed to death

            Are we “Enlightened” humans not responsible for them?

            Out of this came the vision to create an overall support system for these lovely beings and help make their lives worth living.

            A beginning had to be made! With zero experience I set on this journey to satisfy the longing of my soul. A humble beginning was made by identifying all the strays in and around our neighbourhood of Punjabi Bagh. And realizing charity begins from home, it was time to act.

            These four legged became our responsibility – relying on us for their daily meals, deworming, vaccinations and most important of all sterilizations. Our eyes and ears on the road are local milk vendors, dhobi’s, fruit sellers, guards, shopkeepers and last but not the least underprivileged children. They keep us updated regarding medical emergencies, animal cruelty, new born puppies and relocated dogs etc.

            This amazing band of people are effectively providing selfless care and protection to all creatures great and small!

            Our vision at rock bottom is to fire up the light of compassion latent in every individual. Therefore, the focus of our Foundation is to concentrate on eliminating suffering of living beings to the maximum extent possible.

            None of this would have been possible without the greatest blessings and gifts from the Divine. We are all so lucky to be connected by this light of compassion and with a fervent prayer a long distance.
